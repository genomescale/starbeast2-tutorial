# Background

This tutorial walks through through how to set up a calibrated species tree
analysis in StarBEAST2. It follows on from **Species Trees with Relaxed
Molecular Clocks**, which should be attempted first. Calibrated species trees
enable researchers to estimate divergence times for pairs of species, crown
and stem groups, *et cetera*.
